                     <h1>Why You Need To Learn Python</h1>
                     <p>
                        If you love coding, you must be agreeing with the statement that programming, as an intellectual activity, is the only form of art that lets you create interactive art. It allows you to create projects that other people can play with, and you too can talk to them indirectly. Movies flow to the audience in one direction. Paintings do not move. But code goes both ways.

Coders have unlimited prospects when it comes to employment. Learning to code is rapidly becoming a necessary life skill, with millions taking in-person and online courses to learn popular programming languages including C++, Python, Java, Ruby, etc.. Of course, much of your decision about learning a particular coding language depends on what you want to do or create with it.

In this article, I will discuss a few reasons that elaborate why you need to learn Python as your next programming language.

What is Python?

Before we proceed further in the article, let’s have a brief introduction to Python.

Python is basically a general-purpose language. Therefore, it can be used to build just about anything.

Professionally, Python is extremely useful for backend web development, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and data analysis. The language is also used by several developers to build productivity tools, desktop apps, and games.

Why You Should Learn Python

Python is turning 27 years old in 2016. Despite its advanced age, Python remains highly relevant and continues to grow in popularity.

Here is a list of reasons to motivate you to learn Python:

Easy to Learn

When compared to many of the other programming languages, Python is easier to learn. There is no much ceremony to Python’s syntax, making it readable even if you are not too familiar with Python script. Python makes a wise use of white space and common expressions, eliminating the need for including the tiresome variable declarations and the flowery brackets. It also requires less code to complete basic tasks. Python code is often 5-10 times shorter than C++ and 3-5 times shorter than Java.

Versatile

Python can be applied to almost any software development or operations scenario. Be it managing local or cloud infrastructure or developing websites or working against an SQL database. Python can also be used to create custom functions for Hive or Pig. In short, learning Python can give you the skills that apply across a wide range of job roles.

Flexible

As a dynamically typed language, Python is very flexible. The language does not have any hard rules on how to build features, allowing more flexibility to solve problems using different methods. Moreover, Python is considerably forgiving of errors. It lets you compile and run your program until you hit the problematic part.

Cross-platform and Open Source

Python has been developed as Open Source for more than 20 years. It can run on any platform. Python works seamlessly on MacOS, Linux, and Windows. Moreover, Python can be run on small devices like Raspberry-Pi or even the smaller Micro:Bit.

Rich Libraries

Python boasts of a rich library collection. It is backed by PyPI, which is a repository comprising over 85,000 Python modules and scripts that can be used immediately. These modules help to solve problems as diverse as implementing computer vision, working with databases, building RESTful web services or executing advanced data analytics such as sentiment analysis.

High Demand

Python is a commonly-used language in data science, especially because it can be easily integrated into web applications to carry out tasks requiring machine learning. The rise of big data has fuelled the demand for Python developers as data scientists. As of March 2013, Python had the highest year-on-year job demand growth (at 19%) among all programming languages. On Angel List, Python stands as the 2nd most demanded skill and also the skill with the highest average pay offered.

There are not many languages that can offer the simplicity and versatility of Python. Looking at the technology scenario today, there is no denying that Python will continue to reign in terms of relevance. Whether you are a newcomer to the world of code or a script-spewing guru, Python is something you cannot ignore.

                     <h3>An Inspiring Story</h3>
                     <p>XYZ felt trapped. She was well-educated, with a BS in Computer Applications, but she didn’t enjoy her work. She felt drawn to other fields, particularly finance, but wasn’t sure if she could commit to a Master’s Degree – until she discovered the Introduction to Finance Specialization from the University of Michigan on Coursera. Here’s her story:

After completing my Bachelor’s in Computer Application in 2012, I felt pigeonholed into a particular field of study.

I decided to get a little more background knowledge by taking a finance course from the University of Michigan on CoursSpot.
That course ended up being a turning point in my life. I learned that finance isn’t just a set of tools, but a way of thinking – and I learned that I definitely wanted to pursue a career in this field. Today, I have worked a year in the largest commercial bank in India, and I am pursuing my Masters in Finance from Mumbai University.
