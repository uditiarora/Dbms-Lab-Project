                     <h1>Why You Need To Learn MEAN Stack</h1>
                     <p>
                        JavaScript makes sense as a first language because you’ll need to learn it anyway. You can’t do much on the web without it, so people are increasingly going straight to JavaScript and skipping Ruby, Python and PHP. JavaScript also boasts the most active developer community. But there’s a third reason you should learn JavaScript right out of the gate: employability.

Employers aren’t just starved for JavaScript talent — they’re starved for engineers familiar specific JavaScript-based technologies. And those technologies happen to be the ones that compose the MEAN Stack — MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js.

Before we get started, note that these data come from Indeed.com, the largest aggregator of job postings. We’re using the volume of job postings as a proxy for the volume of jobs. We only focused on non-proprietary solutions like Oracle, Microsoft and IBM.

                     <blockquote>
                        MEAN is a user-friendly full-stack JavaScript framework ideal for building dynamic websites and applications. It is a free and open-source stack designed to supply developers with a quick and organized method for creating rapid prototypes of MEAN-based web applications. One of the main benefits of the MEAN stack is that a single language, JavaScript, runs on every level of the application, making it an efficient and modern approach to web development.

                     <h3>An Inspiring Story</h3>
                     <p>XYZ felt trapped. She was well-educated, with a BS in Computer Applications, but she didn’t enjoy her work. She felt drawn to other fields, particularly finance, but wasn’t sure if she could commit to a Master’s Degree – until she discovered the Introduction to Finance Specialization from the University of Michigan on Coursera. Here’s her story:

After completing my Bachelor’s in Computer Application in 2012, I felt pigeonholed into a particular field of study.

I decided to get a little more background knowledge by taking a finance course from the University of Michigan on CoursSpot.
That course ended up being a turning point in my life. I learned that finance isn’t just a set of tools, but a way of thinking – and I learned that I definitely wanted to pursue a career in this field. Today, I have worked a year in the largest commercial bank in India, and I am pursuing my Masters in Finance from Mumbai University.
